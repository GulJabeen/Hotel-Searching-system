# Hotel-Searching-system
Website
Problem
The topic of our project is hotel reservation system. The main problem of choosing hotel reservation system because it is very difficult for tourist and out of city people to look for a hotel according to his needs .If someone wants to reserve a hotel through internet and wants to search
Every hotel .So there is not some very realistic website for this purpose .So it is very difficult for them to decide where to go and it is difficult for a customer to  find out that there are rooms in a 
Hotel and their prices and the exterior and interior of the rooms.



Recommended Solution

The solution is we decide is for this purpose to design such website so it is easy for a customer
To select appropriate hotel. This website will let them to easily look for the hotel according to 
Their range and location. They can easily reserve a hotel else by going to that city 
And making it tough for them to look for appropriate hotel. The functionality of our website will be they can search the hotels only be selecting their range so it will let them to find that hotel
Which are according to their pricesâ€¦They can also select city and the location and prices all together then it will sort out that hotels which are in according to their location and price and 
City. Then it will tell them the exterior and interior of them rooms and which kind of rooms are available for them for example single bed or double bed etc. Then after finding out that specific hotel they can also reserve that hotel and then it will give them the room# and booking# and 
Location of the hotel. It will let them print that final reservation document so that they 
Can show that document to that hotel for confirmation.
